A Pi Pico W based controller for https://github.com/nevermore3d/Nevermore_Max[Nevermore Max] and
https://github.com/nevermore3d/StealthMax[StealthMax] filters.
This controller is BlueTooth LE enabled, minimising required wiring and allowing multiple clients
to interact with the controller.

== Required Hardware

*Refer to the BOM from whatever filter you're building. This is just a basic guide for what kind of hardware is needed.*

NOTE: Sensors are available in various sizes, form factors, and pin orders. Check your filter's BOM to see which you should obtain.

.Recommended Hardware
[%autowidth]
|===
| Part      | Name          | Quantity
| MCU       | Pico W        | 1
| Sensor    | VOC           | 2
|           | Temperature   | 2
|           | Humidity      | 2
|===

NOTE: xref:supported-sensors[Many sensor boards are multi-function.] e.g. you'll likely only need one board for temperature/humidity.

The only hard requirement is a Pico W.
Everything else can be omitted at the cost of reduced functionality.

The VOC sensors are critical; they measure the relevant contaminants we wish to filter out.

The temperature & humidity sensors are optional; they serve to improve the accuracy of the VOC sensor. If they're omitted, the system will assume some sensible defaults instead.

NOTE: In the future, you'll be able to use Klipper sensors/thermistors to provide these values. This isn't as precise as dedicated sensors, but it's better than nothing. e.g. You could use the temperature from your toolhead's MCU for the intake temperature.

== Installation For Dummies

NOTE: Make sure you meet the xref:klipper-requirements[Klipper requirements].

Instructions:

. Build or download the controller `uf2` binaries, flash to Pico W.
+
The Pico W's LED should start flashing once the controller has booted.

. Execute the following to install the Klipper module:
+
```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/SanaaHamel/nevermore-controller
cd nevermore-controller
./install-klipper-module.bash
```

. Add nevermore your printer config. Here's a xref:klipper-config-minimal[trivial configuration example], and xref:klipper-config-full[see here for complete documentation].

. Update your printer macros.

.. Add `SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=nevermore_fan SPEED=1` to your `print_start` macro.footnote:[I suggest adding gcode rather than a macro wrapper because you want the filter to start when the extruder/bed heats up, and your `print_start` probably does a lot of things (homing, QGL, purge, etc).]
+
This'll let you kick-start the filter before the chamber gets detectably filthy. Example:
+
```ini
[gcode_macro PRINT_START]
gcode:
    ... <SNIP YOUR CURRENT GCODE> ...

    # Insert right before heating extruder or bed
    # (e.g. M104, M109, M190, ...)
    # Override automatic control.
    # Start filtering before sensors can detect VOCs.
    SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=nevermore_fan SPEED=1

    ... <SNIP YOUR CURRENT GCODE> ...
```

.. Add `SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=nevermore_fan` to your `TURN_OFF_HEATERS` macro.
+
WARNING: This assumes your `print_end` macro calls `TURN_OFF_HEATERS`. If it doesn't you'll want to put `SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=nevermore_fan` in your `print_end` macro to turn off the fan override.
+
Easiest way would be to put this macro wrapper in your config:footnote:[Wherever you'd like.`TURN_OFF_HEATERS` is a built-in macro, and should never be overridden w/o calling the replaced macro, so it doesn't matter if another macro ends up wrapping this wrapper.]
+
```ini
# ASSUME: Your `print_end` macro calls `TURN_OFF_HEATERS`.
[gcode_macro TURN_OFF_HEATERS]
rename_existing: NEVERMORE_CONTROLLER_INNER_TURN_OFF_HEATERS
gcode:
    NEVERMORE_CONTROLLER_INNER_TURN_OFF_HEATERS
    # Clear the fan control override, we're cooling down
    # NB: Setting SPEED=0 does *NOT* clear control override.
    #     It instead forces the speed to 0.
    #     Omit `SPEED` argument entirely to clear override.
    SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=nevermore_fan
```

. Check your printer's log file. If everything went well you should see something like:
+
```log
... BLAH
... BLAH
Sending MCU 'mcu' printer configuration...
Configured MCU 'mcu' (283 moves)
... BLAH
... BLAH

[11:27:13:981190] nevermore - connected to controller 28:CD:C1:09:64:8F
... BLAH

```

== FAQ / Known Issues

[#faq-is-the-bluetooth-on]
* The controller is properly flashed (e.g. the LED is blinking) but my Klipper can't connect to it.
+
Make sure the Bluetooth is turned on & working.
If you're using Linux you can use the following to check:
+
```
⋊> ~ # ensure BT is on
⋊> ~ bluetoothctl power on
Changing power on succeeded
⋊> ~ # scan to see if we see any BT devices
⋊> ~ # if the nevermore controller is powered on then you should see it listed here
⋊> ~ bluetoothctl scan on

[NEW] Device XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX <censored>
^C⏎
```
+
If `bluetoothctl` works fine and the scan lists the Nevermore controller then something probably went wrong with the Klipper module. Go find me on the Nevermore Discord for help.

* I'm using Mainsail-OS and...
+
This distro disables BlueTooth by default. Unless you're very familiar with Linux, it'll likely be easier to install a new OS. I suggest using a recent Debian and https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh[KIAUH].
+
NOTE: Make sure you back up the `~/printer_data` directory!

* Mainsail doesn't show sensor values other than temperature.
+
https://github.com/mainsail-crew/mainsail/pull/1437[There's a PR for Mainsail which has unofficial support] but until that's merged xref:klipper-config-full[you'll need to use the `class_name_override` hack].

* Mainsail doesn't show sensor values other than temperature and, yes, I applied the `class_name_override` hack.
+
Refresh the webpage. Mainsail assumes that the first time it sees a multi-value sensor (usually when the page loads) that it will always have the same fields. This isn't true for Nevermore controller sensors.
+
NOTE: This is very common with the VOC sensors during controller startup. They take a few seconds to initialise.

* Fluidd doesn't show sensor values other than temperature, even with the `class_name_override` hack.
+
Can't fix due to how Fluidd interprets Klipper state data. https://github.com/fluidd-core/fluidd/pull/1114[There's a PR fixing the issue, but it hasn't received much support.]

== Touch Display Support

Touch display support is early in development and currently very limited. For now you can:

* Long press on the center plot to toggle the fan override on/off

== Software Build Requirements

* Pico-W SDK 1.5.1+
* CMake 3.20+
* C++23 compiler, e.g. GCC 12+ (tested w/ 12.2.1)

== Controller Customisation

`src/config.hpp` contains all user-customisable options.
These options are, for the most part, validated at compile time to prevent mistakes.


=== Pin Assignments

Pins assignments can be modified to suit your board/wiring, but are subject to hardware-related constraints. These are constraints are extensively checked at compile time, and will result in a (hopefully) useful error message if violated. If it compiles, it's a valid configuration.

WARNING: GPIO 0 and 1 are currently hardcoded for UART. They cannot be used in any pin assignments.

WARNING: The default assignments are tentative and will probably change after we get some feedback as to which layouts work best in practice.

[#klipper]
== Klipper

[#klipper-requirements]
=== Requirements

* Klipper using Python 3.7+
* KIAUH-like installation (required by installation script)

TL;DR: If you installed everything using https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh[KIAUH], you should be good to go so long as you installed Klipper with Python 3.

=== Configuration

[#klipper-config-minimal]
==== Minimal Example

This example configuration is suitable for quickly getting up and running.

# required - valid values: `intake`, `exhaust`
sensor_kind: intake

# optional
# If you do not wish to edit your mainsail installation to add `NevermoreSensor`,
# to its list of known sensors, you can use an already recognised classname (e.g. `bme280`)
class_name_override: bme280

# optional - default: false

    breathing  2 1 top (0,.25,0)
```


=== Finding The BT Address

**If you have only one Nevermore controller in range then you can omit the `bt_address` option in your printer configuration and ignore this section entirely.**

If you have multiple BlueTooth (BT) devices in range that look like candidates for a Nevermore controller, then you have to specify which one to use. This is done by specifying their 'address' in the printer config using `bt_address: <address>`.

On Linux and Windows hosts, this address looks like `XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`, where `X` is a hexadecimal digit.

On MacOS hosts, this address is a randomly assigned UUID specific to that host.

NOTE: It is possible, but very rare, for the address to change when a new `uf2` is flashed onto the Pico. This has been observed once after updating the Pico SDK.

==== Method A - Check the Klipper Log

An error will be raised if there are multiple controllers in range.
The error message will list all the available controllers' addresses.

Pick one from the list and stuff that into the `nevermore` section's `bt_address`.

For example, given this log:

```log
...
...
[11:06:36:535560] nevermore - multiple nevermore controllers discovered.
specify which to use by setting `bt_address: <insert-address-here>` in your klipper config.
discovered controllers (ordered by signal strength):
    address           | signal strength
    -----------------------------------
    FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:01 | -38 dBm
    FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:00 | -57 dBm
Config error
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "~/klipper/klippy/klippy.py", line 180, in _connect
    cb()
  File "~/klipper/klippy/extras/nevermore.py", line 793, in _handle_connect
    raise self.printer.config_error("nevermore failed to connect - timed out")
configparser.Error: nevermore failed to connect - timed out
...
...
```

We could use `bt_address: FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:01` or `bt_address: FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:00`.

In this case I'd plug in `FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:01` since that device has the strongest signal, i.e. closest-ish to the Klipper host.

[#find-the-bt-address-bluetoothctl]
==== Method B - Linux Only - `bluetoothctl`

NOTE: Only works on Linux. Yes, I know you didn't read the title.

. Make sure your Nevermore controller is powered and the LED is blinking. (Indicates it is active.)

. In a terminal, run: `bluetoothctl`
+
This'll open a REPL interface.
+
```
⋊> ~ bluetoothctl
Agent registered
[CHG] Controller FA-KE-AD-RE-SS-FF Pairable: yes
[bluetooth]#
```

. Run: `scan on`, **wait a few seconds** (~5 or 6 is plenty)
+
Starts background scan for devices.
This isn't a blocking command, you can issue other commands as it scans in the background.
+
```
[bluetooth]# scan on
Discovery started
[CHG] Controller FA-KE-AD-RE-SS-FF Discovering: yes
[NEW] Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:05 <censored>
[NEW] Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:00 Nevermore
[CHG] Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:05 RSSI: -53
[CHG] Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:04 ManufacturerData Key: 0x004c
...
[DEL] Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:04 FA-KE-AD-RE-SS-04
[NEW] Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:04 FA-KE-AD-RE-SS-04
...
```
+
WARNING: If you wait too long (~15-20 seconds), the scan ends, and the host will forget about the devices it discovered.

. Run: `devices`
+
```
[bluetooth]# devices
Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:05 <censored>
Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:01 Nevermore
Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:04 FA-KE-AD-RE-SS-04
Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:00 Nevermore
Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:02 FA-KE-AD-RE-SS-02
Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:03 FA-KE-AD-RE-SS-03
```
+
Look for the entries named "Nevermore" or "Nevermore Controller", and copy their address into the printer configuration.
+
In this example, we could use `bt_address: FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:00` or `bt_address: FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:01`.


==== Method C - Use Your Phone + nRF Connect

WARNING: If you're hosting Klipper on MacOS then you cannot use this approach and must use <<Method A - Check the Klipper Log>>.

nRF Connect is an app by Nordic Semi.
It's meant for debugging/exploring BLE devices, but we can (ab)use to find the BT addresses.

Load the app, scan for BLE devices. The controllers will all be named "Nevermore", and their BT addresses will be listed below.

.nRF Connect displays device names & addresses
image::README-nrf-connect.png[nRC Connect Screenshot,256]


[#fan-control]
=== Fan Control & Macros

There are two modes of operation:

* Automatic - Fan power is managed by the controller based on its fan policy (xref:klipper-config-full[see here]).

* Manual - Fan power is overridden and will run at the specified power until the override is cleared.

From within Klipper, the fan can be controlled much like any other fan:

```gcode
; override automatic fan control, full speed ahead
SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=nevermore_fan SPEED=1
; not specifying `SPEED=` disables fan override and returns to automatic fan control
SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=nevermore_fan
```

WARNING: Setting the fan speed to 0 in Mainsail/Fluidd UI does **not** clear the control override. It just sets it to zero. (i.e. disables the fan)
