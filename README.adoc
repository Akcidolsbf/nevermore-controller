A Pi Pico W based controller for https://github.com/nevermore3d/Nevermore_Max[Nevermore Max] and
https://github.com/nevermore3d/StealthMax[StealthMax] filters.
This controller is BlueTooth LE enabled, minimising required wiring and allowing multiple clients
to interact with the controller.

== Required Hardware

*Refer to the BOM from whatever filter you're building. This is just a basic guide for what kind of hardware is needed.*

NOTE: Sensors are available in various sizes, form factors, and pin orders. Check your filter's BOM to see which you should obtain.

.Recommended Hardware
[%autowidth]
|===
| Part      | Name          | Quantity
| MCU       | Pico W        | 1
| Sensor    | VOC           | 2
|           | Temperature   | 2
|           | Humidity      | 2
|===

NOTE: xref:supported-sensors[Many sensor boards are multi-function.] e.g. you'll likely only need one board for temperature/humidity.

The only hard requirement is a Pico W.
Everything else can be omitted at the cost of reduced functionality.

The VOC sensors are critical; they measure the relevant contaminants we wish to filter out.

The temperature & humidity sensors are optional; they serve to improve the accuracy of the VOC sensor. If they're omitted, the system will assume some sensible defaults instead.

NOTE: In the future, you'll be able to use Klipper sensors/thermistors to provide these values. This isn't as precise as dedicated sensors, but it's better than nothing. e.g. You could use the temperature from your toolhead's MCU for the intake temperature.

[#guide-setup]
== Setup Guide For Dummies

NOTE: Make sure you meet the xref:klipper-requirements[Klipper requirements].

Instructions:

. Build or https://github.com/SanaaHamel/nevermore-controller/releases[download the controller `uf2` binary], flash to Pico W.
+
The Pico W's LED should start flashing once the controller has booted.

. Execute the following to install the Klipper module:
+
```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/SanaaHamel/nevermore-controller
cd nevermore-controller
./install-klipper-module.bash
```

. If you're using Mainsail OS then the install script will ask if you wish to enable BlueTooth.
Do so, and then restart your Klipper host. (e.g. `sudo reboot`)

. Add nevermore your printer config. xref:klipper-config-minimal[Here's a trivial configuration example you can use.]
+
xref:klipper-config-full[See here for complete documentation.]

. Update your printer macros.

.. Add `SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=nevermore_fan SPEED=1` to your `print_start` macro.footnote:[I suggest adding gcode rather than a macro wrapper because you want the filter to start when the extruder/bed heats up, and your `print_start` probably does a lot of things (homing, QGL, purge, etc).]
+
This'll let you kick-start the filter before the chamber gets detectably filthy. Example:
+
```ini
[gcode_macro PRINT_START]
gcode:
    ... <SNIP YOUR CURRENT GCODE> ...

    # Insert right before heating extruder or bed
    # (e.g. M104, M109, M190, ...)
    # Override automatic control.
    # Start filtering before sensors can detect VOCs.
    SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=nevermore_fan SPEED=1

    ... <SNIP YOUR CURRENT GCODE> ...
```

.. Add `SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=nevermore_fan` to your `TURN_OFF_HEATERS` macro.
+
WARNING: This assumes your `print_end` macro calls `TURN_OFF_HEATERS`. If it doesn't you'll want to put `SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=nevermore_fan` in your `print_end` macro to turn off the fan override.
+
Easiest way would be to put this macro wrapper in your config:footnote:[Wherever you'd like.`TURN_OFF_HEATERS` is a built-in macro, and should never be overridden w/o calling the replaced macro, so it doesn't matter if another macro ends up wrapping this wrapper.]
+
```ini
# ASSUME: Your `print_end` macro calls `TURN_OFF_HEATERS`.
[gcode_macro TURN_OFF_HEATERS]
rename_existing: NEVERMORE_CONTROLLER_INNER_TURN_OFF_HEATERS
gcode:
    NEVERMORE_CONTROLLER_INNER_TURN_OFF_HEATERS
    # Clear the fan control override, we're cooling down
    # NB: Setting SPEED=0 does *NOT* clear control override.
    #     It instead forces the speed to 0.
    #     Omit `SPEED` argument entirely to clear override.
    SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=nevermore_fan
```

. Check your printer's log file. If everything went well you should see something like:
+
```log
... BLAH
... BLAH
Sending MCU 'mcu' printer configuration...
Configured MCU 'mcu' (283 moves)
... BLAH
... BLAH
[11:27:13:976834] nevermore - discovered controller 28:CD:C1:09:64:8F
[11:27:13:981190] nevermore - connected to controller 28:CD:C1:09:64:8F
... BLAH
... BLAH
```

. If you've flashed a OTA-capable UF2 to your controller (v0.3+) you can update it wirelessly.

[#guide-updating]
== Updating Guide For Dummies

If you've flashed a OTA-capable UF2 to your controller (v0.3+) you can update it wirelessly. The process is simple:
```sh
# switch to your nevermore-controller installation
cd ~/nevermore-controller
# fetch updates for klipper module and tools
git pull
# download & apply latest controller image
./tools/update_ota.py
```

The when you run `update_ota.py` it will install any missing dependencies.
This can take a while the first time, depending on the machine's capabilities.

If you have multiple controllers in range, you can specify which to update using `--bt-address`. e.g. `./tools/update_ota.py --bt-address XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`

See `./tools/update_ota.py --help` for all options.

NOTE: The controller will automatically restart if left idle in bootloader mode for 60 seconds.

Overall, you should see output similar to the following:

```
Tool environment seems up to date.
This program will attempt to update a Nevermore controller.

[#faq]
== FAQ / Known Issues

[#faq-is-the-bluetooth-on]
* The controller is properly flashed (e.g. the LED is blinking) but my Klipper can't connect to it.
+
Make sure the Bluetooth is turned on & working.
If you're using Linux you can use the following to check:
+
```
⋊> ~ # ensure BT is on
⋊> ~ bluetoothctl power on
Changing power on succeeded
⋊> ~ # scan to see if we see any BT devices
⋊> ~ # if the nevermore controller is powered on then you should see it listed here
⋊> ~ bluetoothctl scan on
Discovery started
[CHG] Controller XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX Discovering: yes
[NEW] Device XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX <censored>
[NEW] Device XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX <censored>
^C⏎
```
+
If `bluetoothctl` works fine and the scan lists the Nevermore controller then something probably went wrong with the Klipper module. Go find me on the Nevermore Discord for help.

[#faq-mainsail-os]
* I'm using MainsailOS and I'm having trouble with BlueTooth.
+
This distro disables BlueTooth by default. footnote:[Mainsail OS disabled BlueTooth to enable hardware UART on Raspberry Pi SBCs.] Please follow https://docs-os.mainsail.xyz/faq/enable-bluetooth-on-rpi[this guide] to enable BlueTooth. Alternatively, the install script will attempt to apply the changes for you.
+
Alternatively, you can flash Klipper to the Pico and use it like any other Klipper MCU.
+
NOTE: I intend to improve the experience for people using a wired connection instead of wireless (via the Klipper MCU), but have no concrete timeline.

* Mainsail doesn't show sensor values other than temperature.
+
https://github.com/mainsail-crew/mainsail/pull/1437[There's a PR for Mainsail which has unofficial support] but until that's merged xref:klipper-config-full[you'll need to use the `class_name_override` hack].

* Mainsail doesn't show sensor values other than temperature and, yes, I applied the `class_name_override` hack.
+
Update your Mainsail. Older versions had a bug where it would assume that multi-value sensors always had the same fields once they were seen for the first time. This isn't true for Nevermore controller sensors.
+
NOTE: This is very common with the VOC sensors during controller startup. They take a few seconds to initialise.

* Fluidd doesn't show sensor values other than temperature, even with the `class_name_override` hack.
+
Can't fix due to how Fluidd interprets Klipper state data. https://github.com/fluidd-core/fluidd/pull/1114[There's a PR fixing the issue, but it hasn't received much support.]
+
Fluidd is more or less unsupported with regards to sensor display and visualisation. I recommend Mainsail instead.

== Touch Display Support

Touch display support is early in development and currently very limited.
For now you can:

* Long press on the center plot to toggle the fan override on/off
* Press/drag on the fan power ring to set the fan override to a specific percent

== Software Build Requirements

* Pico-W SDK 1.5.1+
* CMake 3.20+
* C++23 compiler, e.g. GCC 12+ (tested w/ 12.2.1)

== Controller Customisation

`src/config.hpp` contains all user-customisable options.
These options are, for the most part, validated at compile time to prevent mistakes.


=== Pin Assignments

Pins assignments can be modified to suit your board/wiring, but are subject to hardware-related constraints. These are constraints are extensively checked at compile time, and will result in a (hopefully) useful error message if violated. If it compiles, it's a valid configuration.

WARNING: GPIO 0 and 1 are currently hardcoded for UART. They cannot be used in any pin assignments.

WARNING: The default assignments are tentative and will probably change after we get some feedback as to which layouts work best in practice.

[#klipper]
== Klipper

[#klipper-requirements]
=== Requirements

* xref:faq-is-the-bluetooth-on[Working BlueTooth on your Klipper host.]
* Klipper using Python 3.7+
* KIAUH-like installation (required by installation script)

TL;DR: If you installed everything using https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh[KIAUH], you should be good to go so long as you installed Klipper with Python 3.

=== Configuration

[#klipper-config-minimal]
==== Minimal Example

This example configuration is intended for quickly getting up and running. You can just copy paste this into your printer's config.

```ini
[nevermore]
# BOM specifies a 16 pixel ring
led_colour_order: GBR
led_chain_count: 16
# Uncomment if this controller is for a StealthMax
# sensors_fallback_exhaust_mcu: true

[temperature_sensor nevermore_intake]
sensor_type: NevermoreSensor
sensor_kind: intake
# Need `class_name_override` to fool mainsail into showing all values. Remove once mainsail PR is merged.
class_name_override: bme280

[temperature_sensor nevermore_exhaust]
sensor_type: NevermoreSensor
sensor_kind: exhaust
# Need `class_name_override` to fool mainsail into showing all values. Remove once mainsail PR is merged.
class_name_override: bme280

[temperature_sensor nevermore_intake_VOC]

=== Finding The BT Address

**If you have only one Nevermore controller in range then you can omit the `bt_address` option in your printer configuration and ignore this section entirely.**

If you have multiple BlueTooth (BT) devices in range that look like candidates for a Nevermore controller, then you have to specify which one to use. This is done by specifying their 'address' in the printer config using `bt_address: <address>`.

On Linux and Windows hosts, this address looks like `XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`, where `X` is a hexadecimal digit.

On MacOS hosts, this address is a randomly assigned UUID specific to that host.

NOTE: It is possible, but very rare, for the address to change when a new `uf2` is flashed onto the Pico. This has been observed once after updating the Pico SDK.

==== Method A - Check the Klipper Log

An error will be raised if there are multiple controllers in range.
The error message will list all the available controllers' addresses.

Pick one from the list and stuff that into the `nevermore` section's `bt_address`.

For example, given this log:

```log
...
...
[11:06:36:535560] nevermore - multiple nevermore controllers discovered.
specify which to use by setting `bt_address: <insert-address-here>` in your klipper config.
discovered controllers (ordered by signal strength):
    address           | signal strength
    -----------------------------------
    FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:01 | -38 dBm
    FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:00 | -57 dBm
Config error
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "~/klipper/klippy/klippy.py", line 180, in _connect
    cb()
  File "~/klipper/klippy/extras/nevermore.py", line 793, in _handle_connect
    raise self.printer.config_error("nevermore failed to connect - timed out")
configparser.Error: nevermore failed to connect - timed out
...
...
```

We could use `bt_address: FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:01` or `bt_address: FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:00`.

In this case I'd plug in `FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:01` since that device has the strongest signal, i.e. closest-ish to the Klipper host.

[#find-the-bt-address-bluetoothctl]
==== Method B - Linux Only - `bluetoothctl`

NOTE: Only works on Linux. Yes, I know you didn't read the title.

. Make sure your Nevermore controller is powered and the LED is blinking. (Indicates it is active.)

. In a terminal, run: `bluetoothctl`
+
This'll open a REPL interface.
+
```
⋊> ~ bluetoothctl
Agent registered
[CHG] Controller FA-KE-AD-RE-SS-FF Pairable: yes
[bluetooth]#
```

. Run: `scan on`, **wait a few seconds** (~5 or 6 is plenty)
+
Starts background scan for devices.
This isn't a blocking command, you can issue other commands as it scans in the background.
+
```
[bluetooth]# scan on
Discovery started
[CHG] Controller FA-KE-AD-RE-SS-FF Discovering: yes
[NEW] Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:05 <censored>

[DEL] Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:04 FA-KE-AD-RE-SS-04
[NEW] Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:04 FA-KE-AD-RE-SS-04
...
```
+
WARNING: If you wait too long (~15-20 seconds), the scan ends, and the host will forget about the devices it discovered.

. Run: `devices`
+
```
[bluetooth]# devices
Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:05 <censored>
Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:01 Nevermore
Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:04 FA-KE-AD-RE-SS-04
Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:00 Nevermore
Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:02 FA-KE-AD-RE-SS-02
Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:03 FA-KE-AD-RE-SS-03
```
+
Look for the entries named "Nevermore" or "Nevermore Controller", and copy their address into the printer configuration.
+
In this example, we could use `bt_address: FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:00` or `bt_address: FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:01`.


==== Method C - Use Your Phone + nRF Connect

WARNING: If you're hosting Klipper on MacOS then you cannot use this approach and must use <<Method A - Check the Klipper Log>>.

nRF Connect is an app by Nordic Semi.
It's meant for debugging/exploring BLE devices, but we can (ab)use to find the BT addresses.

Load the app, scan for BLE devices. The controllers will all be named "Nevermore", and their BT addresses will be listed below.

.nRF Connect displays device names & addresses
image::README-nrf-connect.png[nRC Connect Screenshot,256]


[#fan-control]
=== Fan Control & Macros

There are two modes of operation:

* Automatic - Fan power is managed by the controller based on its fan policy (xref:klipper-config-full[see here]).

* Manual - Fan power is overridden and will run at the specified power until the override is cleared.

In both cases, the fan power is scaled by two factors:

* The `fan_power_coefficient` setting scales in all cases. Useful for limiting noise since the StealthMax recommended fans are more powerful than strictly needed.

* Thermal Limiting scales the actual fan power applied based on the maximum of the intake and exhaust temperatures. This is intended to improve the carbon's effective lifespan, which degrades at high temperatures. This feature can be disabled by setting xref:klipper-config-full[`fan_thermal_limit_coefficient: -1`].


From within Klipper, the fan can be controlled much like any other fan:

```gcode
; override automatic fan control, full speed ahead
SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=nevermore_fan SPEED=1
; not specifying `SPEED=` disables fan override and returns to automatic fan control
SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=nevermore_fan
```

WARNING: Setting the fan speed to 0 in Mainsail/Fluidd UI does **not** clear the control override. It just sets it to zero. (i.e. disables the fan)

If you would like to limit the maximum speed of the fan, e.g. to reduce noise, xref:klipper-config-full[set `fan_power_coefficient` to a value < 1].
